# Google Authentication Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
You mentioned that you've already configured Google Auth settings in Supabase. This guide provides the complete steps for reference.

## Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
     - For development: `http://localhost:5173` (or your dev port)

## Step 2: Supabase Configuration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Providers
3. Enable Google provider
4. Add your Google OAuth credentials:
   - **Client ID**: From Google Cloud Console
   - **Client Secret**: From Google Cloud Console
5. Save the configuration

## Step 3: Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```
