# Company ID-Based Login System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Implemented a company ID-based login system where managers and employees must provide their **Company ID** along with email and password to log in. This ensures that users can only access their specific company's data.

---

## 🎯 Requirements Implemented

### User Flow:
1. **Admin Signs Up** → Creates account + company → Gets company ID
2. **Admin Creates Manager/Employee** → Provides email, password, **and company ID** to the user
3. **Manager/Employee Logs In** → Must enter email, password, **and company ID**
4. **System Validates** → Checks credentials AND company ID match

```typescript

signInManager: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<User>;
signInEmployee: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<User>;

// After
signInManager: (email: string, password: string, companyId: string) => Promise<User>;
signInEmployee: (email: string, password: string, companyId: string) => Promise<User>;
```

#### `signInManager()` Function:
```typescript
const signInManager = async (email: string, password: string, companyId: string) => {
  // Check if manager exists with correct email, password AND company_id
  const { data: manager } = await supabase
    .from('managers')
    .select('*')
    .eq('email', email)
    .eq('password', password)
    .eq('company_id', companyId)  // ✅ NEW: Validate company ID

### 4. **Admin Dashboard** (`src/components/dashboards/AdminDashboard.tsx`)

**Changes:**

#### Updated `UserCredentials` Interface:
```typescript
interface UserCredentials {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  role: string;
  name: string;
  companyId: string;  // ✅ NEW
}
```

#### Updated All `setGeneratedCredentials()` Calls:

**When creating manager/employee:**
```typescript
setGeneratedCredentials({
  email: newUser.email,
  password: newUser.password,
  role: addUserType,
  name: newUser.fullName,
  companyId: userRole.company_id,  // ✅ NEW
});
```

**When showing existing credentials:**
```typescript
setGeneratedCredentials({
  email: user.profile?.email || user.email,
  password: user.profile?.password || user.password || "Not available",
  role: user.role,
  name: user.profile?.full_name || user.full_name,
  companyId: user.company_id || userRole?.company_id || '',  // ✅ NEW
});
```

#### Updated Credentials Modal UI:

Added Company ID display with copy button:
```typescript
<div>
  <label className="text-sm font-medium text-green-800">Company ID:</label>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <p className="text-green-700 font-mono flex-1 text-xs break-all">
      {generatedCredentials?.companyId}
    </p>
    <Button
      size="sm"
      variant="outline"
      onClick={() => {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(generatedCredentials?.companyId || '');
        toast({ title: 'Copied!', description: 'Company ID copied to clipboard' });
      }}
      className="h-8 w-8 p-0"
    >
      <Copy className="h-4 w-4" />
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>
```

Added important notice:
```typescript
<div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-3">
  <p className="text-sm text-blue-800">
    <strong>Important:</strong> {generatedCredentials?.role === 'employee' ? 'Employees' : 'Managers'} 
    must provide their Company ID along with their email and password when logging in.
  </p>
</div>
```

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### Step 1: Admin Signup
1. Admin visits landing page → clicks "Sign Up"
2. Fills in: Full Name, Email, Password
3. System creates:
   - ✅ Admin user in `auth.users`
   - ✅ Company in `companies` table
   - ✅ Admin role in `user_roles` table
4. Admin gets redirected to Company Onboarding
5. Admin fills company details → submits
6. **Company ID is now available** (from `companies` table)

### Step 2: Admin Creates Manager/Employee
1. Admin logs in → goes to dashboard
2. Clicks "Add Manager" or "Add Employee"
3. Fills form: Full Name, Email, Password, Department/Phone, etc.
4. Clicks "Create"
5. **Credentials modal appears showing:**
   - ✅ Name
   - ✅ Email (with copy button)
   - ✅ Password (with copy button)
   - ✅ Role
   - ✅ **Company ID** (with copy button) ← NEW!
6. Admin copies and shares these credentials with the user

### Step 3: Manager/Employee Login
1. Manager/Employee visits login page (Manager Login or Employee Login)
2. Sees 3 required fields:
   - ✅ Email
   - ✅ Password
   - ✅ **Company ID** ← NEW!
3. Enters all 3 pieces of information
4. System validates:
   - ✅ Email exists in `managers`/`employees` table
   - ✅ Password matches
   - ✅ **Company ID matches** ← NEW!
   - ✅ User is active (`is_active = true`)
5. If all valid → Login successful → Redirected to dashboard
6. If any invalid → Error: "Invalid credentials or company ID"

## 🔒 Security Benefits

### Multi-Factor Company Isolation
1. **Email Uniqueness**: Per company (already implemented)
2. **Password Verification**: Standard authentication
3. **Company ID Verification**: NEW - ensures users can only access their company

### Prevents Cross-Company Access
**Before:**
- An employee with correct email/password could potentially access any company's data
- Security relied solely on email/password

**After:**
- Employee MUST know their company ID
- Even with correct email/password, wrong company ID = login fails
- Each company's data is isolated by company ID

### Scenario Protection:

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Employee tries to access another company | ⚠️ Possible if email/password known | ✅ Blocked - needs company ID |
| Manager shares credentials | ⚠️ Security risk | ✅ Less risk - company ID adds layer |
| Brute force attack | ⚠️ 2 factors (email, password) | ✅ 3 factors (email, password, company ID) |
| Data leak | ⚠️ Credentials = access | ✅ Credentials + company ID needed |

---

## 📊 Database Validation

### Query Structure (Manager Login):
```sql
SELECT * FROM managers
WHERE email = 'manager@example.com'
AND password = 'ManagerPass123'
AND company_id = 'abc123-company-uuid'  -- ✅ NEW
AND is_active = true;
```

### Query Structure (Employee Login):
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE email = 'employee@example.com'
AND password = 'EmployeePass123'
AND company_id = 'abc123-company-uuid'  -- ✅ NEW
AND is_active = true;
```

**Result:** User can ONLY login if all 4 conditions match:
1. ✅ Email correct
2. ✅ Password correct
3. ✅ **Company ID correct** (NEW)
4. ✅ Account active

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
